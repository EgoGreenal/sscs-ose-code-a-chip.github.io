# IEEE SSCS Open-Source Ecosystem "Code-a-Chip": Automated DAC design

This project focuses on the design and implementation a Digital to Analog Converter (DAC) using the IHP SG13G2 130nm BiCMOS technology. At the time of the submission (April 2025), the complete specifications-to-GDS flow is only available for the R-2R ladder DAC, but the code structure will allow other topologies to be added without editing the notebook.


## To run this Jupyter notebook

We recomend to open the notebook on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com). The notebook can also be opened on a local Jupyter server.

Alternatively, the python code can be downloaded from https://github.com/SDMote/Automated_DAC_Design.git and executed on a machine with the tools installed (like the [IIC-OSIC-TOOLS Docker container](https://github.com/iic-jku/IIC-OSIC-TOOLS.git)).
